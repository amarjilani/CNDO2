# CNDO/2 SCF 

This project focuses on the implementation of the CNDO/2 (Complete Neglect of Differential Overlap) method within a Self-Consistent Field (SCF) framework to calculate approximate molecular energies. By utilizing CNDO/2, we streamline quantum chemical computations, making them both accessible and efficient for predicting electronic properties of molecules. The simulation is designed to provide rapid and reliable estimations of molecular energy, crucial for understanding chemical reactivity and molecular stability. This tool serves as a vital resource for researchers in chemistry and materials science, facilitating advanced studies in molecular design and reaction mechanisms.
